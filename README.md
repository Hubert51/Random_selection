# Random_selection
Use random module to show Law of Large Numbers.

In the course, professor mentions that if we do not give the boundry to while loop, the loop will not stop, which means it can be running 
limitless. So in the real life, we have some math problem which will use the "law of large numbers". People need to repeat many times of 
experiments to get a result. Use while loop, we can easily to get the result because the computer can do the trials quickly. 
This brunch is wanted to show the law of large number of dice.
